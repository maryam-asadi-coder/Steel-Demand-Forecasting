Project Title: 
Design and Implementation of an Intelligent Dashboard for Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization in the Steel Industry

1. Introduction

The steel industry is one of the most critical sectors of the global economy, serving as a backbone for construction, automotive, oil & gas, and other industries. Market volatility, demand fluctuations, and high storage and transportation costs make supply chain management in steel highly challenging.
In this context, leveraging data-driven demand forecasting models and inventory optimization algorithms can significantly enhance production efficiency, cost reduction, and competitiveness.

2. Objectives

Develop an interactive dashboard for monitoring demand, inventory, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Forecast 12 weeks of steel demand using time-series models (Holt-Winters).

Calculate optimal levels of Safety Stock and Reorder Point based on demand variability and lead time.

Provide insights to reduce risks of stockouts or overstocking.

Evaluate system performance using KPIs such as OTIF and Waste Reduction.

3. Methodology

Collect historical demand and inventory data.

Data preprocessing and exploratory statistical analysis.

Design and train a forecasting model (Holt-Winters).

Implement algorithms for Safety Stock and Reorder Point.

Develop the dashboard using Streamlit + Plotly.

Define and measure KPIs.

4. Expected Outcomes

Up to 20% improvement in demand forecasting accuracy compared to traditional methods.

10–15% reduction in waste and inventory holding costs.

Achieving service levels (OTIF) above 95%.

Faster and data-driven decision-making for steel plant managers.

5. Conclusion

This project will transform the steel plant’s supply chain from a reactive system to a predictive and intelligent system. The outcome will not only improve operational efficiency and profitability but also strengthen the plant’s competitive position in the global steel market.
